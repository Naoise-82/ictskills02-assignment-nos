# Assignment - ReactJS app.

Name: Naoise O'Sullivan

## Overview.

This app is designed to be similar to the movies app we created in the labs, but using the **Internet Game Database (IDGB)** API to retieve information about video games, consoles and game characters. I have limited the scope of the API calls in the app to retieve games and hardware from consoles, as opposed to all platforms (PC/Mac/Linux, Mobile/Tablet (Android/iOS), Arcade etc.) to simplify the filter cards and clean up the results from API calls.


### User Features
 
 + A *Homepage* similar ot the movies app, with a random list of 30 games
 + A *My Collection* Page similar to the *Favourite Movies* page from the movies app. I had intended to use a POST request to the IDGB API to add these to a personal list on my account with them, and also the ability to add a percentage of completion to each game, but I discovered that this is not actually an available feature of the API currently.
 + A *Consoles* page listing games consoles in order of the their generations (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_video_game_console_generations)


## Setup requirements.

+ I had to use a third party proxy called *thigproxy* running locally on my machine to forward requests to the API in order ot get around CORS issues.
+ Here is the link to the repo of my configured version of the proxy: https://github.com/Naoise-82/thingproxy.
+ All you need to do is clone the repo to your local machine and run it using `npm start` from the terminal, and then you can run the assigment app.
+ The assignment is configure to forward API requests to the *thingproxy* server on port 4000.


## API Data Model.

![IGDB API Model][model]
>The primary parent obect of the DB is **Game**, and this diagram represents the paramters of the game object that are either objects or arrays themselves that I have used in the app

## App Design.

### Component catalogue.

![Storybook Components Screenshot][stories]

### UI Design.

![Homepage/Games List][game-list-view]
>Home page view, which is a list of "random" games, curated from the DB



![Console List][console-list-view]
>A list of game consoles, ordered by generation, with parameterized links to the the wikipedia articles relating to their generation.



![Game Detail Page][game-detail-view]
>A view of a single game's details. The platform chips are parameterized links to theor respective console detail pages.



![Console Detail Page][console-detail-view]
>A view of a game console's details page. The **generation** chip is a link to a wikipedia article relating to the generation of the console.



![Game Colection Page][game-collection-page]
>An analogue to the *favourite movies* page form the labs, games can be added and remove from youe collection, which is conceptually meant to reflect the actual physical copies of the games that you own.


### Routing.

**Note:** All the API requests to IGDB are actually POST requests by design, even though they can behave as GET or POST requests.

+ GET */* - renders the HomePage/Browse All Games view.
+ GET */games/collection* - View the games adedd to your collection.
+ GET */games/:id* - View the details of a particular game.
+ GET */consoles* - View a list of Game Consoles
+ GET */consoles/:id* - View the details of a particular console

## Independent learning (If relevant).

....... Briefly state any technologies/techniques used in your project codebase that was not covered in the lectures/labs. Provide source code filename (source code excerpts are not required in most cases) references to support your assertions and include references (articles/blogs) ......... 

+ My main source of new learning was from the IGDB API documentation for handling the API requests: https://api-docs.igdb.com/#about
+ I also used the **ImageLIst** component fomr Material-UI for the screenshots list on the Game Details Page: https://material-ui.com/components/image-list/
+ I used **Axios** for my API requests, as was suggested in the documentation for JavaScript web apps.
