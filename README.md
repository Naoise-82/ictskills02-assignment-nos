# Assignment - ReactJS app.

Name: Naoise O'Sullivan

## Overview.

This app is designed to be similar to the movies app we created in the labs, but using the **Internet Game Database (IDGB)** API to retieve information about video games, consoles and game characters. I have limited the scope of the API calls in the app to retieve games and hardware from consoles, as opposed to all platforms (PC/Mac/Linux, Mobile, Arcade etc.).

### User Features
 
 + A *Homepage* similar ot the movies app, with a random list of 30 games
 + A *My Collection* Page similar to the *Favourite Movies* page from the movies app. I had intended to use a POST request to the IDGB API to add these to a personal list on my account with them, but I discovered that this is not actually an available feature of the APi currently.
 + A *Consoles* page listing games consoles in order of the their generations (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_video_game_console_generations)
 + 

## Setup requirements.

+ I had to use a third party proxy called *thigproxy* running locally on my machine to forward requests to the API in order ot get around CORS issues.
+ Here is the link to the repo of my configured version of the proxy: https://github.com/Naoise-82/thingproxy.
+ All you need to do is clone the repo, and run it using `npm start` from the terminal, and then you can run the assigment app.
+ The assignment is configure to forward API requests to the thing proxy server on port 4000.

## API Data Model.
